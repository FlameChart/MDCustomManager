This project is **assisted by AI**, not **generated by AI**. I will take every responsibility of my code / bugs.

This project is mainly focusing on Windows, **no other platform will be considered**. ~~because no one want to play 
Modded MuseDash on Linux / Android. and there has some good alternative on the Android platform like MDCustomPlay and 
MDExtra~~
